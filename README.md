# Website
##Project: "Create Your Own Website"
This project is part of the DevelopHer 2025 program by Holberton School.

##Website Theme Selection
For this project, I have chosen the theme "Cyber Threats in Australia" due to my strong interest in cybersecurity and the growing importance of understanding and addressing cyber risks within the Australian context.

##Important
This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
