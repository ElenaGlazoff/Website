##Project: "Create Your Own Website"

This project is part of the DevelopHer 2025 program by Holberton School.

##Website Theme Selection. For this project, I have chosen the theme "Cyber Threats in Australia" due to my strong interest in cybersecurity and the growing importance of understanding and addressing cyber risks within the Australian context.

##Important. This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.

##Purpose and Requirements

#Develop an Engaging Homepage
- Create a file named index.html to serve as the main landing page of your website. This page should include the following elements:
- At least four paragraphs of meaningful content. Proper headings using HTML tags h1, h2, and h3 to create a clear content hierarchy. 
 - Clickable image that links to any external URL of your choice.

#Create a Secondary Page: tweets.html
- Design a complementary page titled tweets.html, which may feature any content you choose. 

- However, the following requirements must be met: Embed at least one tweet using Twitter’s official embed code. Include a link back to index.html to enable users to return to the homepage. 

#Set Up Styling with CSS
- Create an empty stylesheet file named styles.css. In each of your HTML files, add those two lines:

'''link href="https://apply.holbertonschool.com/level2/school.css" rel="stylesheet"'''
'''link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"'''

 
- In each of your HTML files, add those two lines within the tag:
- The school.css file is hosted externally and cannot be modified.

#For this project, CSS Flexbox will be used to structure the layout. The desired layout should include the following elements in order: header, article, aside, footer and main, body.

#Implement a Smart Thumbnail Feature.

#Display a large image as a smaller thumbnail, allowing users to click to enlarge the image.

#Add Social Sharing Functionality Include social sharing icons for at least Twitter and Facebook, allowing visitors to easily share your website.

#Enable Disqus Comments Integrate Disqus to allow visitors to post comments and engage with your content.
Ensure Mobile Compatibility. The website must be fully responsive and function correctly on smartphones.

##Additional Features I Included 
- Embedded an additional tweet using Twitter’s embed code.
- Included a table under section 4 to enhance visual representation and structure.
