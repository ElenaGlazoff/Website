# Website
##Project: "Create Your Own Website"
This project is part of the DevelopHer 2025 program by Holberton School.

##Website Theme Selection
For this project, I have chosen the theme "Cyber Threats in Australia" due to my strong interest in cybersecurity and the growing importance of understanding and addressing cyber risks within the Australian context.

##Important
This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.

## Purpose and Requirements

1. Develop an Engaging Homepage
1.1 Create a file named index.html to serve as the main landing page of your website. This page should include the following elements:

- At least four paragraphs of meaningful content.

- Proper headings using HTML tags <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> to create a clear content hierarchy.

-  clickable image that links to any external URL of your choice.

2. Create a Secondary Page: tweets.html
2.1 Design a complementary page titled tweets.html, which may feature any content you choose. However, the following requirements must be met:

- Embed at least one tweet using Twitter’s official embed code.

- Include a link back to index.html to enable users to return to the homepage.

- Ensure index.html also contains a link to tweets.html to facilitate smooth navigation.

3. Set Up Styling with CSS
3.1 Create an empty stylesheet file named styles.css.
3.2 In each of your HTML files, add those two lines within the <head> tag:

<link href="https://apply.holbertonschool.com/level2/school.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"> 

3.3 The school.css file is hosted externally and cannot be modified.
3.4 For this project, CSS Flexbox will be used to structure the layout. The desired layout should include the following elements in order:

<header> content

<article> content

<aside> content

4. Implement a Smart Thumbnail Feature

4.1 Display a large image as a smaller thumbnail, allowing users to click to enlarge the image.

5. Add Social Sharing Functionality
Include social sharing icons for at least Twitter and Facebook, allowing visitors to easily share your website.

6. Enable Disqus Comments
Integrate Disqus to allow visitors to post comments and engage with your content.

7. Ensure Mobile Compatibility
The website must be fully responsive and function correctly on smartphones.

##Additional Features I Included
Embedded an additional tweet using Twitter’s embed code.

Included a table under section 4 to enhance visual representation and structure.
